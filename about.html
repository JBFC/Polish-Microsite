                Created in 1990 by Martin Scorsese, The Film Foundation is dedicated to protecting and preserving motion picture history. By working in partnership with the leading archives and studios, the foundation has saved over 600 films. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through The Story of Movies, the organization’s ground-breaking educational program that is currently used in over 100,000 classrooms. Joining Scorsese on the board of directors are filmmakers Woody Allen, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Curtis Hanson, Peter Jackson, Ang Lee, George Lucas, Alexander Payne, Robert Redford, and Steven Spielberg. The Film Foundation is aligned with the Directors Guild of America. Margaret Bodde is executive director and Jennifer Ahn is managing director of the foundation.

                <h4>Milestone Film & Video</h4>
                Started in 1990 by Amy Heller and Dennis Doros, Milestone has since gained an international reputation for releasing restored classic cinema masterpieces, documentaries and American independent features. Thanks to the company’s work in rediscovering and releasing important films such as Charles Burnett’s Killer of Sheep, Kent Mackenzie’s The Exiles, Lionel Rogosin’s On the Bowery, Mikhail Kalatozov’s I Am Cuba, Marcel Ophuls’ The Sorrow and the Pity, the Mariposa Film Group’s Word is Out, and the films of Shirley Clarke, Milestone occupies a position as one of the country’s most influential independent distributors. The company’s many awards include six Archival and Film Heritage Awards from the National Society of Film Critics; two commendations from the New York Film Critics Circle; the International Film Seminars’ prestigious Leo Award; and honors from the Fort Lee Film Commission, Il Cinema Ritrovato, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and Anthology Film Archives. Doros has served on the Board of Directors of the Association of the Moving Image Archivists since 2009.
