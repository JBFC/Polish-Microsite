          <p>Andrzej Wajda was born on March 6, 1926 in Suwalki, Poland to Aniela Wajda, a teacher, and Jakub Wajda, a captain in the Polish infantry. In 1940, one year after Poland was invaded by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, Wajda's father was killed by Stalin's agents in the Katyn massacre.</p>

          <p>In 1942, Wajda joined the Polish resistance and served in the Armija Krajowa until the war ended in 1945. In 1946 he moved to Krakow where he attended the Academy of Fine Arts. Wajda had his most formative educational experience from 1950-1954, when he studied film directing at the High Film School in Łódź under directors Jerzy Toeplitz and Aleksander Ford. </p>

          <p>In 1955 he directed his first full-length feature film, A Generation, about the generation of youth coming of age during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Although he was under pressure from the Soviet-dominated Polish authorities, Wajda positioned himself as an artist who was above the conflict. Wajda’s film Man of Iron won the Palme d'Or at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival and The Promised Land won the Golden Prize at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival in 1975.</p>

          <p>Four of Wajda's films (The Promised Land, The Maids of Wilko, Man of Iron, and Katyń ) have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 2000, Wajda received an honorary Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and in 2006 he was awarded an honorary Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.
            From 1989 to 1991 Wajda was elected Senator of the Republic of Poland. From 1992 to 1994 he was Member of Presidential Council for Culture. In 1994 he founded the Center of Japanese Art and Technology in Krakow, and was awarded the Order of Rising Sun in Japan (1995). Wajda was President of Polish Film Association (1978-1983) and was a member of "Solidarity" Lech Walesa Council (1981-1989). </p>

            <p>Jerzy Kawalerowicz was born on January 19, 1922 in Gwoździec, Poland and died on December 27, 2007 in Warsaw, Poland. Noted for his powerful, detail-oriented imagery and the depth of ideas in his films, Kawalerowicz made his directorial debut with the 1951 film The Village Mill. He was a leading figure in the Polish Film School, and his films Shadow (1956) and Night Train (1959) constitute some of that movement's best work. His 1966 adaptation of Bolesław Prus' historical novel, Pharaoh, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. His film Death of a President won the Silver Bear for an outstanding artistic contribution at the 1978 Berlin International Film Festival.</p>

            <p>In 1955 Kawalerowicz was appointed head of the prestigious KADR production unit and held that position again in 1972. He resisted pressures from the communist administration to produce propaganda films and his studio produced some of the best Polish films by Andrzej Wajda, Tadeusz Konwicki, and Juliusz Machulski.</p>

            <p>Kawalerowicz was viewed as an authoritative voice in film and as such, he served as a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival in 1969 and the 9th Moscow International Film Festival in 1975. In 1976 he was the head of the jury at the 26th Berlin International Film Festival. At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival he was a member of the jury and was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema.

        <p>Krzysztof Kieślowski was born on June 27, 1941 in Warsaw, Poland and died on March 13, 1996 in Warsaw. At sixteen, Kieślowski briefly attended a firefighters' training school, but dropped out after three months. Without any career goals, he entered the College for Theatre Technicians in Warsaw in 1957 because it was run by a relative. He wanted to become a theatre director, but needed at least a bachelor's degree to apply for the theatre school, so he chose to study film as a first step. </p>

        <p>After college, Kieślowski applied to the Łódź Film School, the famed Polish film school which also has Roman Polanski and Andrzej Wajda among its alumni. He was rejected twice, but accepted on his third attempt.</p>  

        <p>Kieślowski received numerous awards throughout his career, including the Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize and the FIPRESCI Prize for A Short Film About Killing in 1998. 1995 he received Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Writing for Three Colors: Red. In 2002 Kieślowski was listed at number two on the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound Top Ten Directors list of modern times.</p>

        <p>Kieślowski retired from filmmaking with a public announcement after the premiere of his last film Three Colors: Red at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. Just under two years after announcing his retirement, Krzysztof Kieślowski died on March 13, 1996 at age 54 during open-heart surgery following a heart attack, and was interred in Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. His grave has a sculpture of the thumb and forefingers of two hands forming an oblong space—mimicking the view through a movie camera. He was survived by his wife Maria and daughter Marta. Kieślowski remains one of Europe's most influential directors and his works continue to be the study of film classes at universities throughout the world.

        <p>Konwicki was born on June 22, 1926 in Nowa Wilejka, Poland where he spent his early childhood. His adolescence was spent in Wilno, which was occupied by the Soviet Union and then Nazi Germany immediately following the outbreak of World War II. At that time, all education for Poles was discontinued. Konwicki continued his studies underground and in 1944, he joined the ranks of a local Home Army partisan unit, taking part in Operation Tempest and Operation Ostra Brama. After the war Wilno was annexed by the Soviet Union and Konwicki was expatriated.</p>

        <p>In the spring of 1945 Konwicki moved to Kraków, where he enrolled at Jagiellonian University. Before he began his career in film, he worked as a journalist at Odrodzenie Weekly, moving to Warsaw in 1947 to continue his work for the magazine. From 1952-1966 Konwiki was a member of the Polish United Workers' Party and was one of the leading advocates for Socialist Realism in literature. His literary debut was the production novel Construction Site (1950), which was followed by the novel Power (1954). By the mid-1950s, Konwicki had become disillusioned by the communist regime in Poland and fell out of grace with the party.</p>

        <p>After separating himself from the communist regime, Konwicki became the head of the Kadr Film Studio. Due to its uniquely bitter quality, his work veered away from the style pursued by his contemporaries. His film The Last Day of Summer won the Venice '58 Grand Prix.</p>

        <p>Along with his award-winning films, Konwiki is widely known for two novels, published by the Polish underground press: The Polish Complex (1977) and A Minor Apocalypse (1979). The latter work, a bitter satire about a washed-up writer who is asked to burn himself in front of the Soviet-built Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw, was subsequently adapted as the basis of a French film bearing the same title. A Minor Apocalypse is a post-Orwellian parody that refers to specific historical events, such as self-immolation protests against the communist regime by Ryszard Swiec in Poland and Jan Palach in Czechoslovakia. </p>

        <p>Konwicki currently lives in Warsaw and continues to inspire young writers and filmmakers.</p>

          <p>Wojciech Has was born April 1, 1925 in Kraków, Poland and died October 3, 2000 in Łódź, Poland. During the wartime German occupation of Poland, Has studied at the Kraków Business and Commerce College and later clandestine underground classes at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts, until it was disbanded in 1943. When the war ended, he went on to study at the reconstituted Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków. In 1946, Has completed a one-year course in film and began producing educational and documentary films at the Warsaw Documentary Film Studio. In the 1950s he moved on to work at Poland's premier filmmaking academy, the National Film Studio, in Łódź.</p>

          <p>In 1948, Has made his film debut with Harmony, a medium-length feature, and began making full-length feature films in 1957. Early on in his career, Has gained a reputation as an individualist who avoided political overtones in his art. He sought to create films in which the problems and storylines of his protagonists were always secondary to the particular world he had created. His works are commonly associated with Surrealist painting in Polish criticism, reinforced by the director's dream poetic and his use of objects. </p>

          <p>In 1974, he was appointed as professor in the directing department at the National Film School in Łódź. Throughout his long and prolific career, he directed such notable films as The Saragossa Manuscript, The Doll, and The Hour-Glass Sanatorium. From 1987 to 1989, Has was artistic director of the Rondo Film Studio and a member of the Polish State Cinema Committee. In 1989-1990, he served as dean of the directing department at the National Film School and in 1990 he became the school's provost, remaining in this position for six years. He was the managing director and chief advisor at the school-affiliated Indeks Studio.

        <p>Aleksander Ford was born on November 24, 1908 in Kiev, Russian Empire and died April 4, 1980 in Naples, Florida. Ford made his first feature film, Mascot, in 1930, after a year of making short silent films. He did not use sound until The Legion of the Streets in 1932. When World War II began, Ford escaped to the Soviet Union and established a film unit for the Soviet-sponsored People's Army of Poland in the USSR. Ford was the head of the Polish People's Army Film Crew in the Soviet Union during World War II and became director of the nationalized Film Polski Company following the Red Army liberation of Poland. In 1948 the new communist authorities appointed him professor of the National Film School in Łódź. Among his students were filmmakers Roman Polanski and Andrzej Wajda. </p>

        <p>After the war, Ford was appointed head of the government-controlled Film Polski and held enormous sway over the country's entire film industry. Ford and a group of colleagues from the Polish Communist Party rebuilt most of the country's film production infrastructure. For the next twenty years, Ford served as professor at the state-run National Film School in Łódź. He is perhaps best remembered for directing the first postwar documentary Majdanek – the Cemetery of Europe and the feature film Knights of the Teutonic Order, based on a novel of the same name by Polish author Henryk Sienkiewicz.</p>

        <p>Ford, a self-identified Communist, used his films to "express social messages on the screen," and continued making films in Poland until the 1968 Polish political crisis. Accused of antisocialist activity and expelled from the Communist Party, Ford emigrated to Israel where he lived for the next two years. He later moved to Denmark and eventually settled in the United States. In the United States, Ford made two more feature films, The First Circle and The Martyr, both of which were commercial and critical failures. Blacklisted by the Polish communist government as a political defector, Ford was no longer relevant in contemporary discussions and analysis of Polish filmmaking. As a result, he committed suicide in a Florida hotel on April 4, 1980.</p>
